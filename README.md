# intel-edison-pin-breakout
Pin breakout of the Intel Edison Hirose connector to through-hole pin headers for prototyping.

##PCB Design software and addons used

1. Eagle 7.3.0: I use Standard but Light should still be able to open/modify the files.
2. Intel Edison library by [Sparkfun](https://github.com/sparkfun/Sparkfun_Blocks_Template) (in repo as Edison.lbr)

##Schematic drawings

Images are exported from Eagle at 600dpi.
